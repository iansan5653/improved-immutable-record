# # Security Policy

I am extremely dedicated to ensuring the security of this library. In order to ensure that goal, I
keep the complexity of the library to an absolute minimum, and only use dependencies that I trust
completely.

## Supported Versions

All versions are supported with regards to security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerability reports will always be handled with absolute priority. The best way to report a
vulnerability is to [notify NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/report), who will analyze your
report and take the appropriate action along with alerting me.
